# Corruption Invariant Learning for Cross-Modal ReID
 The official repository for [Benchmarks for Corruption Invariant Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00880) (NeurIPS 2021 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks) on cross-modal person ReID datasets, including SYSU-MM01, RegDB-C.

# Quick Start
### 1.Train
Train a CIL model on SYSU-MM01,

```
sh z_train.sh
```

### 2.Test
Evaluate the CIL model on SYSU-MM01,

```
sh z_test.sh
```
